# Book List App

This project showcases a single-page application (SPA) built with React, demonstrating the conversion of web components into React components, leveraging React Router for seamless navigation without page refreshes, and incorporating Bootstrap for styling and a responsive navigation bar.

## Features

- Display book information dynamically using React components.
- Use React Router for navigation between the "Home" page and the "Book List" page without reloading the page.
- A responsive navigation bar created with Bootstrap.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Node.js installed.
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
4. Install the dependencies by running `npm install`.
5. Start the application with `npm start`. The app will run on `localhost:3000`.

## Refactoring and Design Decisions

- **Conversion to React Components:** Transitioned from static HTML to dynamic React components to enhance maintainability and scalability.
- **Routing:** Implemented React Router to allow users to navigate between pages seamlessly, enhancing the user experience.
- **Bootstrap Navigation Bar:** Chose Bootstrap for the navigation bar to ensure responsiveness and a modern look.

## Challenges and Solutions

Faced challenges in integrating React Router for a seamless navigation experience. Overcame this by referring to official documentation and examples to understand its implementation better.

## Conclusion

This project is a step towards understanding the power of React in building dynamic, single-page applications. It demonstrates the core principles of React components, routing, and the integration of third-party libraries for styling and functionality.
